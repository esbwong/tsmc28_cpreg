For simulations:

1. Run PSS with some transient time to make sure reaching steady state.
2. Run PSTB for the feedback loop to check gain/phase margins

3. Need to rerun for various output load current conditions....

For LDO need to decide whether to connect output load to the master branch or to the slave branches...
